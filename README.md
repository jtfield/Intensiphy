# Intensiphy

Intensiphy is an expansion of function wrapper for the [Extensiphy pipeline](https://github.com/McTavishLab/extensiphy/tree/main). With Intensiphy, you can specify the organism you wish to add to your starting phylogeny and raw genomic data will be found in the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). Those sequences will be assembled with Extensiphy and added to your phylogeny automatically. If your query organism is used for too much broad research that you don't want included in your phylogeny, you can input a csv file of SRA IDs that you would specifically like to include and Intensiphy will do the rest!
